# Three Variable Diffusive Model âœ¨

In this model, we implemented finite difference method on *U(x, y, t)* - prey and *V(x, y, t)* - predator.
- The cell size we have taken as
dx = 0.8; dy = 0.8 and final x and y values we have taken as 10. You may also try with higher values as given in the paper. 
- The time interval
dt = 0.0025 and total simulation time we have taken as T = 1000 for viewing the plotted graph faster. But on the article, they have used T = 100000.
- Stationary patterns are generated for several values of constant injection rate g (in the code change the value of g accordingly to check the change in pattern)


_As an example, the graph for g = 45.0 is given below:_

_and the contour plot will be:_
